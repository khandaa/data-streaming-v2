# Network Topology Enhancement - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the network topology of the Secure Kafka Connector POC. The current implementation has interconnected networks that do not provide sufficient isolation between source and target Kafka instances. We will restructure the network configuration to ensure the connector serves as the sole bridge between source and target environments, improving security and isolation.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- Isolate Network 1 (source) and Network 3 (target) completely from each other
- Establish Network 2 as the exclusive bridge between source and target environments
- Ensure exactly-once message delivery is maintained with the new topology
- Maintain secure TLS connections between all components

### Success Metrics
- Zero direct communication between Network 1 and Network 3
- 100% message delivery from source to target Kafka instances
- All security features and monitoring capabilities remain functional
- Successful completion of network resilience tests

## 3. Security Classification & Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Required |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Data Breach | M | H | High | Y |
| Unauthorized Access | M | H | High | Y |
| Data Loss | L | H | Medium | Y |
| Service Disruption | M | M | Medium | Y |
| Compliance Violation | L | M | Low | Y |
| Privacy Violation | L | M | Low | Y |

**Data Classification:** Confidential
**Risk Level Assessment:** High
**Threat Model Summary:** The primary threats include unauthorized access to Kafka clusters, interception of messages between networks, and potential data exfiltration. The new network topology reduces the attack surface by ensuring all cross-network communication passes through the controlled connector application.

## 4. User Stories

- As a security architect, I want to ensure complete network isolation between source and target environments so that a compromise in one environment cannot directly impact the other.
- As a system administrator, I want the connector to be the sole communication channel between source and target networks so that I can monitor all data transfer through a single point.
- As a developer, I want to maintain the same functional interface for the connector despite network topology changes so that application code changes are minimized.
- As a security analyst, I want to ensure the TLS authentication between all components remains intact so that security posture is not weakened by the network changes.

## 5. Functional Requirements

1. The connector must be able to consume messages from the source Kafka instance on Network 1
2. The connector must be able to produce messages to the target Kafka instance on Network 3
3. The connector must maintain exactly-once message delivery semantics
4. The Kafka UI must be able to monitor both source and target Kafka instances
5. All existing functionality must continue to work with the new network topology

## 6. Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- Maintain TLS mutual authentication for all Kafka connections
- Ensure secure access to the Kafka UI through the reverse proxy

### Data Protection
- Ensure data in transit is encrypted via TLS between all components
- Maintain secure Avro serialization/deserialization of messages

### Communication Security
- Remove direct network connectivity between Network 1 and Network 3
- Implement Network 2 as the only bridge between source and target environments
- Configure Docker networks to prevent unauthorized cross-network communication

### Audit and Logging
- Maintain logging of all message transfers between source and target Kafka instances
- Log connection events and authentication successes/failures

## 7. Technical Architecture Considerations

### Current Architecture
The current architecture allows the connector to connect to all three networks:
- Network 1: Source Kafka and Zookeeper
- Network 2: Kafka UI 
- Network 3: Target Kafka and Zookeeper, Reverse Proxy

### Enhanced Architecture
The enhanced architecture will:
- Keep Network 1 isolated with Source Kafka and Zookeeper
- Configure Network 2 to connect to both Network 1 and Network 3 (but not directly connecting them)
- Keep Network 3 isolated with Target Kafka and Zookeeper
- Place the connector in Network 2 only
- Ensure the Kafka UI in Network 2 can still monitor both Kafka instances

## 8. Implementation Requirements

### Docker Compose Changes
1. Update network configuration to remove direct connectivity between all networks
2. Configure connector to connect only to Network 2
3. Ensure Network 2 can communicate with both Network 1 and Network 3
4. Update network definitions to enforce isolation

### Connector Application Changes
1. Review and update connection parameters as needed
2. Ensure TLS certificates are properly configured for the new network topology
3. Validate exactly-once message delivery with the new network structure

### Testing Requirements
1. Verify connector can consume from source Kafka and produce to target Kafka
2. Validate no direct communication is possible between Network 1 and Network 3
3. Test resilience to network outages and Kafka restarts
4. Verify TLS authentication works correctly with the new configuration

## 9. Documentation Updates Required
1. Update README.md with new architecture diagram and description
2. Update architecture diagram to reflect the new network topology
3. Update CHANGELOG.md to document the network topology enhancement
4. Document the security improvements from the network isolation

## 10. Open Questions & Dependencies
1. Will the Kafka UI require additional configuration to connect to both Kafka instances?
2. Are there any performance implications from routing all traffic through the connector?
3. How will monitoring and alerting be affected by the network changes?

## 11. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Implementing new security features beyond network topology changes
2. Modifying the Avro schema or message format
3. Changing the functionality of the connector application
4. Modifying the reverse proxy configuration

## 12. Implementation Timeline
1. Network configuration updates: 1 day
2. Testing and validation: 1 day
3. Documentation updates: 0.5 day
4. Total estimated effort: 2.5 days

## 13. Security Review Checkpoints
1. Network topology design review - Before implementation
2. Configuration security review - During implementation
3. Network isolation testing - After implementation
4. Final security validation - Before release
