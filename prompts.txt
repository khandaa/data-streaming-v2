use @create-prd.mdc to create a PRD document for project. Build an application with 4 applications. 1. source kafka instance that will generate events and will run on network 1 2. target kafka instance where the consumed events will be written. This should be on network3. 3. Connector application that can connect to both network1 to read messages and network3 to write messages. It will sit in network2. All these networks are isolated from each other. 4. Kafka UI application on network2 that can monitor topics from both kafka instance1 and kafka instance2 and monitors the messages transferred from kafka instance1 to kafka instance2. use docker to create all of the instances of the applications. 


Clarifications -  This is a POC to prove that a connector can be written between two streaming applications and data can be transferred securely. 2. An IT team will maintain this system 3. this is a POC so let the connector support a simple schema only 4. write the user stories yourself. 5. The key criteria for success is - successful transfer of messages from kafka instance1 to kafka instance2 by a connector that is secure . 7. let the solution support avro. exactly once delivery is required. 9. yes the connector should handle network outages, kafka restart and message replays 10. use docker-compose, TLS authentication, reverse proxy
